    "import sys\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now, let's analyze the main code. As a first step, we read the image \"starry_night.jpg\" from the OpenCV samples. In order to do so, a call to the [**cv::imread**](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d4/da8/group__imgcodecs.html#ga288b8b3da0892bd651fce07b3bbd3a56) function loads the image using the file path specified by the first argument.

    "- IMREAD_UNCHANGED loads the image as is (including the alpha channel if present)\n",
    "- IMREAD_GRAYSCALE loads the image as an intensity one\n",
    "After reading in the image data will be stored in a [**cv::Mat**](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d3/d63/classcv_1_1Mat.html) object.\n",

    "\n",
    "> **Note**\n",
    "OpenCV offers support for the image formats Windows bitmap (bmp), portable image formats (pbm, pgm, ppm) and Sun raster (sr, ras). With help of plugins (you need to specify to use them if you build yourself the library, nevertheless in the packages we ship present by default) you may also load image formats like JPEG (jpeg, jpg, jpe), JPEG 2000 (jp2 - codenamed in the CMake as Jasper), TIFF files (tiff, tif) and portable network graphics (png). Furthermore, OpenEXR is also a possibility.\n",

    "## 2.2 Getting Started with Videos\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal\n",
    "- Learn to read video, display video, and save video.\n",
    "- Learn to capture video from a camera and display it.\n",
    "- You will learn these functions : [**cv.VideoCapture()**](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d8/dfe/classcv_1_1VideoCapture.html), [**cv.VideoWriter()**](https://docs.opencv.org/master/dd/d9e/classcv_1_1VideoWriter.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Capture Video from Camera\n",
    "Often, we have to capture live stream with a camera. OpenCV provides a very simple interface to do this. Let's capture a video from the camera (I am using the built-in webcam on my laptop), convert it into grayscale video and display it. Just a simple task to get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "To capture a video, you need to create a **VideoCapture** object. Its argument can be either the device index or the name of a video file. A device index is just the number to specify which camera. Normally one camera will be connected (as in my case). So I simply pass 0 (or -1). You can select the second camera by passing 1 and so on. After that, you can capture frame-by-frame. But at the end, don't forget to release the capture.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import cv2 as cv\n",
    "cap = cv.VideoCapture(0)\n",
    "if not cap.isOpened():\n",
    "    print(\"Cannot open camera\")\n",
    "    exit()\n",
    "while True:\n",
    "    # Capture frame-by-frame\n",
    "    ret, frame = cap.read()\n",
    "    # if frame is read correctly ret is True\n",
    "    if not ret:\n",
    "        print(\"Can't receive frame (stream end?). Exiting ...\")\n",
    "        break\n",
    "    # Our operations on the frame come here\n",
    "    gray = cv.cvtColor(frame, cv.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)\n",
    "    # Display the resulting frame\n",
    "    cv.imshow('frame', gray)\n",
    "    if cv.waitKey(1) == ord('q'):\n",
    "        break\n",
    "# When everything done, release the capture\n",
    "cap.release()\n",
    "cv.destroyAllWindows()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`cap.read()` returns a bool (`True`/`False`). If the frame is read correctly, it will be `True`. So you can check for the end of the video by checking this returned value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, cap may not have initialized the capture. In that case, this code shows an error. You can check whether it is initialized or not by the method **cap.isOpened()**. If it is `True`, OK. Otherwise open it using [**cap.open()**](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d6/dee/group__hdf5.html#ga243d7e303690af3c5c3686ca5785205e).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also access some of the features of this video using **cap.get(propId)** method where propId is a number from 0 to 18. Each number denotes a property of the video (if it is applicable to that video). Full details can be seen here: [**cv::VideoCapture::get()**](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d8/dfe/classcv_1_1VideoCapture.html#aa6480e6972ef4c00d74814ec841a2939). Some of these values can be modified using **cap.set(propId, value)**. Value is the new value you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, I can check the frame width and height by `cap.get(cv.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH)` and `cap.get(cv.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT)`. It gives me 640x480 by default. But I want to modify it to 320x240. Just use `ret = cap.set(cv.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH,320)` and `ret = cap.set(cv.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT,240)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**\n",
    "If you are getting an error, make sure your camera is working fine using any other camera application (like Cheese in Linux).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Playing Video from file\n",
    "Playing video from file is the same as capturing it from camera, just change the camera index to a video file name. Also while displaying the frame, use appropriate time for `cv.waitKey()`. If it is too less, video will be very fast and if it is too high, video will be slow (Well, that is how you can display videos in slow motion). 25 milliseconds will be OK in normal cases.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import cv2 as cv\n",
    "cap = cv.VideoCapture('vtest.avi')\n",

    "    if not ret:\n",
    "        print(\"Can't receive frame (stream end?). Exiting ...\")\n",
    "        break\n",
    "    gray = cv.cvtColor(frame, cv.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)\n",
    "    cv.imshow('frame', gray)\n",
    "    if cv.waitKey(1) == ord('q'):\n",
    "        break\n",
    "cap.release()\n",
    "cv.destroyAllWindows()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**\n",
    "Make sure a proper version of ffmpeg or gstreamer is installed. Sometimes it is a headache to work with video capture, mostly due to wrong installation of ffmpeg/gstreamer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Saving a Video\n",
    "So we capture a video and process it frame-by-frame, and we want to save that video. For images, it is very simple: just use `cv.imwrite()`. Here, a little more work is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "This time we create a **VideoWriter** object. We should specify the output file name (eg: output.avi). Then we should specify the FourCC code (details in next paragraph). Then number of frames per second (fps) and frame size should be passed. And the last one is the isColor flag. If it is `True`, the encoder expect color frame, otherwise it works with grayscale frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "[FourCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FourCC) is a 4-byte code used to specify the video codec. The list of available codes can be found in fourcc.org. It is platform dependent. The following codecs work fine for me.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Fedora: DIVX, XVID, MJPG, X264, WMV1, WMV2. (XVID is more preferable. MJPG results in high size video. X264 gives very small size video)\n",
    "- In Windows: DIVX (More to be tested and added)\n",
    "- In OSX: MJPG (.mp4), DIVX (.avi), X264 (.mkv).\n",
    "FourCC code is passed as `cv.VideoWriter_fourcc('M','J','P','G')` or `cv.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'MJPG')` for MJPG.\n",

    "\n",
    "- img : The image where you want to draw the shapes\n",
    "- color : Color of the shape. for BGR, pass it as a tuple, eg: (255,0,0) for blue. For grayscale, just pass the scalar value.\n",
    "- thickness : Thickness of the line or circle etc. If **-1** is passed for closed figures like circles, it will fill the shape. default thickness = 1\n",

    "\n",
    "### Drawing Line\n",
    "To draw a line, you need to pass starting and ending coordinates of line. We will create a black image and draw a blue line on it from top-left to bottom-right corners.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",

Next argument is axes lengths (major axis length, minor axis length). angle is the angle of rotation of ellipse in anti-clockwise direction. startAngle and endAngle denotes the starting and ending of ellipse arc measured in clockwise direction from major axis. i.e. giving values 0 and 360 gives the full ellipse. For more details, check the documentation of [**cv.ellipse()**](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d6/d6e/group__imgproc__draw.html#ga28b2267d35786f5f890ca167236cbc69).

Just create a list of all the lines you want to draw and pass it to the function. All lines will be drawn individually. It is a much better and faster way to draw a group of lines than calling [**cv.line()**](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d6/d6e/group__imgproc__draw.html#ga7078a9fae8c7e7d13d24dac2520ae4a2) for each line.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Goal\n",
    "- Learn to bind trackbar to OpenCV windows\n",
    "- You will learn these functions : [**cv.getTrackbarPos()**](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d7/dfc/group__highgui.html#ga122632e9e91b9ec06943472c55d9cda8), [**cv.createTrackbar()**](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d7/dfc/group__highgui.html#gaf78d2155d30b728fc413803745b67a9b) etc.\n",
    "Code Demo\n",
    "Here we will create a simple application which shows the color you specify. You have a window which shows the color and three trackbars to specify each of B,G,R colors. You slide the trackbar and correspondingly window color changes. By default, initial color will be set to Black.\n",
    "\n",
    "For [**cv.createTrackbar()**](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d7/dfc/group__highgui.html#gaf78d2155d30b728fc413803745b67a9b) function, first argument is the trackbar name, second one is the window name to which it is attached, third argument is the default value, fourth one is the maximum value and fifth one is the callback function which is executed every time trackbar value changes. The callback function always has a default argument which is the trackbar position. In our case, function does nothing, so we simply pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important application of trackbar is to use it as a button or switch. OpenCV, by default, doesn't have button functionality. So you can use trackbar to get such functionality. In our application, we have created one switch in which application works only if switch is ON, otherwise screen is always black.\n",
